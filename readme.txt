Adds a postcode lookup tool into WooCommerce's billing and shipping address areas on the Checkout. The postcode lookup tool uses https://getaddress.io to do the lookups, and an API key is therefore required. See installation instructions below.

== Description ==
This plugin enables your customers to complete their billing/shipping address by entering their postcode and selecting their address from the options given.

It utilises onemap.gov.sg (https://www.onemap.gov.sg/docs/#search) to do the lookup.

It can optionally be turned off for the shipping or billing addresses.

== Requirements ==
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org). Tested up to version 5.7.
[WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com). Tested with versions up to 5.3.0, minimum version is likely 4.9.0.

== Installation ==
Install via the WordPress Plugin Directory, or download a release from this repository and install as you would a normal WordPress plugin.

== Usage ==
Once installed and activated, you need to go to the WooCommerce -> Settings -> General page in the WordPress dashboard. Enable or disable shipping & billing address
